# AtomSim

Soft body simulation using atoms connected with springs in an [octet truss mesh](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-typical-example-of-an-octet-truss-mesh-It-is-comprised-of-an-octahedral-grid-with_fig6_4015919). I wrote it from scratch during a two-week internship at the local university. You can see the results [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z-G9e8HcBg1xo4Fpxa567JAkOlcG-DZn?usp=sharing).
